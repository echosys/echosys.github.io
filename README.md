### A-Current Projects

- Web Mining Class Project Topic Summarization and  Visualization   
Obtained patent data with Scrapy and BigQuery, then used LDA algorithm to summarize the topics, reduced dimension with TSNE and visualized the clustered topics using matplotlib
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/blob/main/A20%20Topic%20Summarization/code_573.py)

- Senior Design Project Inventory Scraping and Analytics   
Automated business analytics by scraping inventory from client and competitor’s site, then compared inventory availability and optimized efficiency with Chromium API to reduce scraping time for up to 30% and circumvent anti-scraping measures.
For more details see [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/tree/main/A30%20Senior%20Design%20Inventory%20Analysis).

- Online Banking Prototype   
Developed a full stack web application to support bank transactions and security features such as two factor authentication and hash encryption of user data. Passed penetration testing by classmates.  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/tree/main/A35%20Online%20Banking%20with%20SpringBoot/src/main/java/com/onlinebanking/service)

- Trend Analysis for Class Search  
Utilized Selenium to scrape enrollment information and store in a database. Notified user by email and text when a class becomes open or new seats added. Suggested the likelihood of getting into a closed class by studying past trend.  
Automated registration as soon as spots are open.
For more details see [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/tree/main/A45%20Trend%20Analysis%20for%20Class%20Search).

### B-Scripts

- Directory Scraping and Data Mining   
Scape ASU public directory and store in databases to allow search by school and research interests. Find interesting information on public salary information and prediction future salary based on past data.
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/tree/main/Scripts/dirasu)

- Batch Webpage Parsing for Video Source Link  
The protected Wistia video link do not require login to access even though the Instructure page that access it does.
This script demonstrates this exploit by parsing the webpages and extracts direct download links for raw video source packets embedded in the javascript. I have informed Wistia about this issue.

- Google Drive Reduce Size and Archive   
There is no option on Google Drive to download all other files within a folder for archive but keep all the Google Docs since they do not take up space. Instead of downloading all Google Docs as Word file, this script keeps all Google Docs and remove space consuming files for archive to make space for next semester.
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/echosys/demo/blob/main/Scripts/gdrive_t3c.py)

- ASU registration automation  
Automated class registration as soon as a spot opens.
